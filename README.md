## My process
First, I analyzed both the desktop and mobile design to identify the general structure of the HTML code, which elements to use and which sections will make up the final UI. Some elements are specific for one of the two designs and therefore are hidden by default or will be hidden when a certain breakpoint is reached.
Using BEM naming convention for naming classes on sections and components. SCSS partials helped breakdown making styling every component easier than stacking them up in a huge CSS file.
Lastly, I used JS to toggle the navigation menu and prevent window scrolling on mobile view and to toggle the desktop background image and navbar elements on desktop view.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned
I learned more about the SCSS folder structure. Also this was my first time using ES6 modules to break down my JavaScript code into more manageable files.
